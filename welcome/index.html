				<h1>IEEE EMC2 2023 Welcome Message from the General Chairs</h1>
				<p align=justify>
				The progress towards the human and national development goals suffered significant setbacks due to the social and economic repercussions of the CODIV-19 pandemic. These setbacks came amidst a climate crisis that has been festering for decades. We must therefore continue to consider how to build forward better from these crises. The research community at large, and the IEEE in particular, can and should contribute to the response to the climate crisis as well as the economic and health recovery needed to manage, and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
				</p>
				<p align=justify>
				Electronics-based and information technologies can contribute to reducing the causes and impact of climate change. Today, the availability of technologies ranging from social media to nanoelectronics, from IoT to artificial intelligence, can help better understand climate change and can help societies adapt to climate change that has already occurred and mitigate the change in the future. Research must therefore focus on both adaptation and mitigation.
				</p>
				<p align=justify>
				The “Electronics to Mitigate the Climate Change, EmC2” workshop will focus the contribution of these technologies to both exacerbating climate change, and to addressing climate change. We will consider four themes – areas in which the impacts of climate change are heavily felt – human health, migration, food security and poverty. This deliberations, recommendations and actions of this brainstorming workshop will lead a white paper to be shared widely. 
				</p>
				<p align=justify>
				The format of the workshop this year is based on four half days dedicated to the four themes. Each thematic half-day will start with a framework keynote to explain the specific theme; this will be followed by 3 mini-keynotes on action being taken on the theme. This will be followed by a discussion between the panelists (the keynote speakers) and the audience.
				</p>
				<p align=justify>
				We would like to express our gratitude to University of Science and Technology of Oran (USTO) for his support, to our sister Societies SSC, EDS and SSIT and to Sensors and Nano Councils.
