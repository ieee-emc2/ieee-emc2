				<h1>IEEE EMC2 2023 Welcome Message from the General Chairs</h1>
                <p align=justify>
				With COVID-19, the world continues to face a major pandemic and its social and economic repercussions, including major setbacks in the progress towards the human and national development goals. This comes amidst a climate crisis that has been festering for decades. It is therefore the critical moment to consider how to build forward better from these crises. The research community at large, and the IEEE, can and should contribute to the response to the climate crisis as well as the economic and health recovery needed to manage, and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                <p align=justify>
				Electronics-based and information technologies can contribute to reducing the impact of climate change. Today, the availability of technologies ranging from social media to nanoelectronics, from IoT to artificial intelligence, can help better understand climate change and can help societies adapt to climate change. Research must therefore focus on adaptation – how electronics and information technologies can help reduce the negative impacts of climate change.
                <p align=justify>
				The “Electronics to Mitigate the Climate Change, EmC2” workshop will focus on for impacts of climate change: Health, Population displacement and Migration, Food Security and Poverty. It’s a brainstorming workshop with the objective to end up with recommendations and an action plan summarized in a white book.
                <p align=justify>
				On 29 morning we’ll have 5 keynotes followed by a Q&A session with the keynotes. The participants are then divided into four groups, according to the topics addressed by the workshop, to start brainstorming in the afternoon and the second day morning. The last half day will be a plenary session to present and discuss the outcomes from the four groups.
                <p align=justify>
				We would like to express our gratitude to Singapore Tourist Bureau for his support, to our sister Societies SSC and EDS and to Sensors and Nano Councils.
