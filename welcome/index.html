				<h1>IEEE EMC2 2021 Welcome Message from the General Chair</h1>
                <p align=justify>
				With COVID-19, the world continues to face a major pandemic and its social and economic repercussions, including major setbacks in the progress towards the human and national development goals. This comes amidst a climate crisis that has been festering for decades. It is therefore the critical moment to consider how to build forward better from these crises. The research community at large, and the IEEE, can and should contribute to the response to the climate crisis as well as the economic and health recovery needed to manage, and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                <p align=justify>
				There is a bidirectional link between the electronics and information technologies communities, and climate change. 
                <p align=justify>
				On the one hand, electronics-based and information technologies can contribute to reducing the impact of climate change. Today, the availability of technologies ranging from social media to nanoelectronics, from IoT to artificial intelligence, can help better understand climate change and can help societies adapt to climate change. Research must therefore focus on adaptation – how electronics and information technologies can help reduce the negative impacts of climate change.
                <p align=justify>
				On the other hand, the market for electronics and information technologies is a major contributor to climate change. To name but three examples - the very poor management of electronic waste, the inordinate exploitation of natural resources (land, water) for production of electronics-based gadgets, and the high pollution caused by this production. Research must also therefore focus on mitigation – better understanding how the electronics market contributes to climate change and devising solutions to reduce this contribution.
                <p align=justify>
				The “ICT and Climate Change” conference aims to contribute to both these dimensions of adaptation and mitigation, by encouraging efforts to understand, disseminate and resolve the ways that the digital and information technologies markets cause climate change; and by showcasing and promoting ICT-based solutions to understand the nature of climate change and ICT-based solutions to reducing climate change.
