				<strong>Title: </strong>Food Security, Climate Change, and Electronics<br>
				<strong>Abstract: </strong> 
				Current climate change is negatively affecting agricultural production, primarily putting food security at risk in the future and causing substantial economic losses to the agri-food chain. On the other hand, agriculture is impacting the climate change being the responsible of at least one third of the Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions and without an important change on the way we produce food this number will continue to increase. Electronics and technology in general can play an important role on the change food production is requesting. The talk will present first the impact of climate change in agriculture, then the impact of agriculture on climate change, and then how technology can help to mitigate it.

				<strong>Title: </strong>Climate-Smart Agriculture for Environment Care<br>
				<strong>Abstract: </strong> 
				As reported in the report recently issued by the United Nations (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – IPCC Report 2021), the benefits that technology provides to a green and sustainable economy are highly appreciated and under intense research and development globally. Actual technologies, applied in the domain of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA), can bring the needed functionalities and performances for reaching eco-friendly, circular and practical solutions, having as one of the main targets the Food Security. By CSA is possible to obtain more controlled quality production, water use optimisation, and a lower spreading of pesticides and fertilisers, serving the improvement of food quality, but also helping the respect of agriculture for the environment.
				<br>
				For reaching these targets, electronics are the perfect tool for interfacing the data sources, extracting the data and processing them, and obtaining the needed information along the whole food chain: from the farmer, and the professional stakeholders to the consumers.
				<br>
				In the keynote talk, an overview of electronics for precision agriculture will be presented, analysing the possible solutions that can bring important innovations, advancing the actual strategies based on remote or indirect measurements, by instead in-place measuring the plant and soil parameters (a.k.a. Let the Plants do The Talking), associated with more standard information derived from environmental conditions. Application scenarios for crop monitoring, water control, information communication and decision support will be presented. In particular, will be analysed technologies for reaching the needed levels of low power and low cost, and the efficient ones to be applied to AgriFood at the global scale, supporting Food Security, Sustainability and Care of the Environment.

				<strong>Title: </strong>Adaptation to Agro-Climatic Changes and Food Security Challenge<br>
				<strong>Abstract: </strong> 
				Water is a vital resource for the demographic and economic development of the world and, at present, has become a rare and precious commodity and constitutes an indispensable vital element for the individual and society. The imbalance between growing demand and reduced supply leads to the problem of water management and scarcity.
				Climate change has seriously disrupted the rainfall pattern, affecting the quantity and quality of this resource, leading to water shortages in rain-fed agriculture and is therefore a major threat.
				Water use in agriculture has long been characterized by low efficiency due to high losses, and water management as a resource is a key environmental issue, with the consequences of climate change leading to an increased demand of irrigation water which requires an effective methodology for water management.

				<strong>Title: </strong>Reviving Wheatstone Bridge for Accurate Sensing and Mitigating Climate Change: Digital Wheatstone Bridge
				<br>
				<strong>Abstract: </strong> 
				In order to make the environment sustainable and mitigate climate change we need to monitor accurately some parameters like temperature, humidity and pressure. The proposed talk caters to this need by using a novel, digital implementation of the classical Wheatstone bridge for resistive sensors. The “de facto” way of measuring a resistance is using calibrated current sources and an A/D converter for measuring the voltage or Wheatstone bridges. Wheatstone bridges require amplifiers for correcting nonlinearity, A/D converters for digitizing the analog output and means for offset correction. Hitherto, the Wheatstone bridge introduces inherent linearity error that renders higher errors in the measurement. Its digital implementation provides an accurate counterpart for increasing accuracy and compactness.

				<strong>Title: </strong>Reviving Wheatstone Bridge for Accurate Sensing and Mitigating Climate Change: Digital Wheatstone Bridge
				<br>
				-->
				<strong>Abstract: </strong> 
				Climate change is becoming the main driver of forced migration and human mobility. Several recent large-scale migratory movements around the world have been caused and forced by climate change, which is causing extreme flooding around the world. An increasing number of people, both on the coasts and inland, are forced to live with this increased and permanent threat that exacerbates the situations of vulnerability and displacement of local populations within their country or abroad. In this context, we target floods as a major climate-related hazard, as they are the main culprits of the most recent global losses in natural disasters and the first actor to blame for population displacement in flood-prone areas around the world.
				<br>
				The prediction and prevention of climate migrants due to natural disasters such as floods is growing due to rapid climate change, and Early Warning Systems (EWS) are one of the most effective tools for flood risk disaster reduction and one of the most urgent measures to be implemented to attenuate floods impact on vulnerable populations.
				<br>
				Flood risk reduction technologies such as early warning systems (EWS) are being implemented on a large scale, from local to global areas, to manage, monitor and reduce the impact on vulnerable populations at risk of flooding. This could include preparedness plans, evacuation plans and emergency response measures in areas where they are most needed, saving lives and minimizing property damage. With the help of early warning systems technology (EWS), humanitarian organizations and governments can develop more effective strategies to respond to floods and help floodaffected populations before it’s too late as recently expressed by the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations during the celebration of World Meteorological Day.
				<br>
				New York, 23 March 2022 the UN Secretary General said: 
				<br>
				Today, one-third of the world’s people, mainly in least developed countries and small island developing states, are still not covered by early warning systems. In Africa, it is even worse: 60 per cent of people lack coverage. This is unacceptable, particularly with climate impacts sure to get even worse. Early warnings and action save lives. To that end, today I announce the United Nations will spearhead new action to ensure every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems within five years.
				<br>
				As the demand for early warning system solutions grows and so do the solutions offered, many barriers remain poorly understood in the world’s most vulnerable places (social, organizational, and scientific). Identifying specific problems as early as possible and providing solutions before they become "roadblocks" to successful implementation is a vital step that is easy to say, but surprisingly often not achieved.

				<strong>Abstract: </strong> 
				Climate change appears to be causing more frequent extreme weather events and natural disasters around the world, including but not limited to heat waves, hurricanes, floods, droughts, wildfires, sea level rise and erratic weather patterns, often resulting in short-term displacement and long-term migration from affected areas. Due to the reality of climate change, human displacement due to natural disasters and extreme weather conditions is expected to become more frequent. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the geographical conditions that are more likely to be negatively affected by climate change and the resulting patterns of human displacement in order to better mitigate future climate change-induced migration scenarios for both displaced and host populations. The speaker will conduct a literature review on the existing literature on the geography of climate change and migration. The speaker will also illustrate the long-term migration patterns induced by climate change using quantitative data from 17 countries in Latin America, which could serve as a tool for predicting impacts on climate change on migration and help engineers create a roadmap for climate change actions.

				<strong>Title: </strong>Understanding Climate Change and the Role of Electronics in Mitigation</strong>
				<br>
				<strong>Abstract: </strong> 
				The role of electronics in climate change mitigation is a central focus of this study highlights their contribution to renewable energy generation through efficient capture, conversion, and distribution of solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, tidal, and wave energy. Electronics also enable energy storage solutions, energy efficiency improvements in various sectors, the development of smart grids, and the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid. Additionally, electronics facilitate intelligent energy management systems, the electrification of transportation, and the optimization of energy consumption in buildings, industrial processes, and data centers.
				<br>
				Also it underscores the critical role of electronics in addressing climate change and promoting sustainable development. By leveraging electronic technologies, societies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance energy efficiency, and transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of climate change and fostering a more sustainable future.

				<strong>Title: </strong>Electronic Technologies and Collective Action for Flood Resilience in Derna, Libya</strong>
				<br>
				<strong>Abstract: </strong> 
				This study critically examines the intensifying phenomenon of flooding in Derna, Libya, attributing its primary causation to climate change. It underscores the severe ramifications of heightened precipitation and suboptimal drainage infrastructure, culminating in extensive flooding. The discourse centers on the application of electronic technologies and innovative methodologies to alleviate these impacts. Central elements encompass real-time surveillance employing electronic sensors, sophisticated early warning mechanisms, comprehensive data examination, predictive analysis, and the augmentation of communication technologies in emergency situations. The implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), and Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping is accentuated as indispensable in effective flood management and disaster response strategies. Furthermore, the discussion stresses the necessity of cooperative strategies that involve governmental entities, local communities, and the business sector in efficiently addressing flood hazards and fostering a resilient future. The overarching work posits the imperative role of electronic innovations and collective initiatives in confronting the challenges posed by climate change-induced floods in Derna, Libya.
