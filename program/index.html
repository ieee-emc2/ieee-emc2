				<h2>The Food Security theme</h2>
				<p align="justify">
				The purpose of this track is to analyze the impact of climate change on food security and on agribusiness. The population is growing and according to FAO from United Nations the productivity of the agribusiness sector needs to increase by 70% for 2050 to be able to feed the earth population. The increase of the productivity has to be sustainable as the impact of agriculture on climate change is important providing more than 25% of GHG emissions.

				The track considers one keynote, 3 mini-keynotes and a panel.

				<strong>Title: </strong>Food Security, Climate Change, and Electronics<br>
				<strong>Abstract: </strong> 
				Current climate change is negatively affecting agricultural production, primarily putting food security at risk in the future and causing substantial economic losses to the agri-food chain. On the other hand, agriculture is impacting the climate change being the responsible of at least one third of the Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions and without an important change on the way we produce food this number will continue to increase. Electronics and technology in general can play an important role on the change food production is requesting. The talk will present first the impact of climate change in agriculture, then the impact of agriculture on climate change, and then how technology can help to mitigate it.

				<strong>Title: </strong>Climate-Smart Agriculture for Environment Care<br>
				<strong>Abstract: </strong> 
				As reported in the report recently issued by the United Nations (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – IPCC Report 2021), the benefits that technology provides to a green and sustainable economy are highly appreciated and under intense research and development globally. Actual technologies, applied in the domain of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA), can bring the needed functionalities and performances for reaching eco-friendly, circular and practical solutions, having as one of the main targets the Food Security. By CSA is possible to obtain more controlled quality production, water use optimisation, and a lower spreading of pesticides and fertilisers, serving the improvement of food quality, but also helping the respect of agriculture for the environment.
				<br>
				For reaching these targets, electronics are the perfect tool for interfacing the data sources, extracting the data and processing them, and obtaining the needed information along the whole food chain: from the farmer, and the professional stakeholders to the consumers.
				<br>
				In the keynote talk, an overview of electronics for precision agriculture will be presented, analysing the possible solutions that can bring important innovations, advancing the actual strategies based on remote or indirect measurements, by instead in-place measuring the plant and soil parameters (a.k.a. Let the Plants do The Talking), associated with more standard information derived from environmental conditions. Application scenarios for crop monitoring, water control, information communication and decision support will be presented. In particular, will be analysed technologies for reaching the needed levels of low power and low cost, and the efficient ones to be applied to AgriFood at the global scale, supporting Food Security, Sustainability and Care of the Environment.

				<strong>Title: </strong>Adaptation to Agro-Climatic Changes and Food Security Challenge<br>
				<strong>Abstract: </strong> 
				Water is a vital resource for the demographic and economic development of the world and, at present, has become a rare and precious commodity and constitutes an indispensable vital element for the individual and society. The imbalance between growing demand and reduced supply leads to the problem of water management and scarcity.
				Climate change has seriously disrupted the rainfall pattern, affecting the quantity and quality of this resource, leading to water shortages in rain-fed agriculture and is therefore a major threat.
				Water use in agriculture has long been characterized by low efficiency due to high losses, and water management as a resource is a key environmental issue, with the consequences of climate change leading to an increased demand of irrigation water which requires an effective methodology for water management.

				<strong>Title: </strong>Reviving Wheatstone Bridge for Accurate Sensing and Mitigating Climate Change: Digital Wheatstone Bridge
				<br>
				<strong>Abstract: </strong> 
				In order to make the environment sustainable and mitigate climate change we need to monitor accurately some parameters like temperature, humidity and pressure. The proposed talk caters to this need by using a novel, digital implementation of the classical Wheatstone bridge for resistive sensors. The “de facto” way of measuring a resistance is using calibrated current sources and an A/D converter for measuring the voltage or Wheatstone bridges. Wheatstone bridges require amplifiers for correcting nonlinearity, A/D converters for digitizing the analog output and means for offset correction. Hitherto, the Wheatstone bridge introduces inherent linearity error that renders higher errors in the measurement. Its digital implementation provides an accurate counterpart for increasing accuracy and compactness.
