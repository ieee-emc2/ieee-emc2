                    <li><b>History: </b>Algeria's history is rich and complex, with evidence of human habitation dating back thousands of years. Throughout its history, the region has been inhabited by various Berber tribes, and it has been under the rule of several empires, including the Phoenicians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, and Arabs. In the 19th century, Algeria was colonized by France, leading to a long and brutal war of independence that culminated in Algeria gaining independence in 1962.</li>
                    <li><b>Culture and Language: </b>Algeria's culture is a blend of Berber, Arab, and French influences due to its historical interactions.

					</ul>
                <p align="justify">
				A tour will be organized in the desert: more information on the tour later
				</p>
                <p align="justify">
				<b>Sahara, </b>desert situated in the North of Africa, extends over ten countries (from Morocco to Mauritania, including Sudan and Niger), however it is on the Algerian territory that it occupies most surface. The term Sahara is of Arabic origin (As-Sahara) which means desert or steppe. Thus it is the pleonasm that to say the "desert of Sahara".
				</p>
                <p align="justify">
				It is a hot and dry desert: in summer, it is more than 50 degrees during the day; in winter, he can be 5 degrees at high altitude. Previously, Sahara was swampy. Place setting of steppe and savanna, its fauna was very rich. Today there are only fossils lost in the sand and the rock paintings left by our ancestors in caves. It is a place where the time seems not to have grip anymore on the life so much dunes, changing according to the wind, are short-lived and the unchanging and eternal rocks. The silence is master of a kingdom where the beauty of the landscapes of the rise and the sunset, taking colors seen nowhere else, takes the breath away of the spectator.
				</p>
                <p align="justify">
				<b>The Big Erg: </b>Ergs are big massifs of dunes which occupy approximately 20 % of the surface of Sahara. They evolve according to prevailing wind. Weather conditions are extremely severe there. The rare tracks of vegetation concentrate in small oases situated in the perimeter of the desert. Among the biggest, we find in the North that of El Oued. However it is in the Big western Erg that we find the gardens of Saoura. Of the name of the oued which crosses it, the valley of Saoura is really one of the most attractive regions of the Algerian South.
				</p>
                <p align="justify">
				Gourara is a region of Algeria formed of a set of oasis. Encircled by the Big Western Erg (in the North), Touat and Saoura (on the West) and plateau of TadmaÃ¯t (in the South and in the East), an immense flat and rocky area which separates it from Tidikelt (AÃ¯n Salah). Just like Touat (Adrar) and Tidikelt, this region uses the system of irrigation of Foggaras (system of captation of waters of infiltrations). The Big Erg, it is also Beni AbbÃ¨s, Guirzim, Kerzaz, Timoudi, the oases of Gourara and the closeness of the cities of Laghouat, GhardaÃ¯a and BÃ©char. This apparently impassable barrier was always crossed by the caravans which make the connection between oases spread in the waves of sand. The main cities, lining the Big Western Erg, are El Meniaa (so called El GolÃ©a), Timimoun (Gourara) and Adrar (Touat).
