                <h1>About Singapore</h1>
                <p align="justify">
				Singapore is located along the equator in the heart of Southeast Asia with the country’s Standard Time being 8 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT+8). Singapore’s year-round tropical climate is characterised by uniform temperature, high humidity and abundant rainfall. The 31ºC (88ºF) average temperature drops to around 24ºC (75ºF) in the evenings, making the city suitable to host events all year round. The currency used is the Singapore dollar (SGD) and there is no restriction on foreign exchange transactions in Singapore.
				</p>
                <p align="justify">
				Singapore consists of one main island along with 62 other islets. The mainland measures 50km from East to West and 27km from North to South, with a land area of about 710km<sup>2</sup>. Singapore enjoys racial harmony and social cohesion with a multi-ethnic population of about 5.6 million comprising 74% Chinese, 13% Malays, 9% Indians and 4% Eurasians and other ethnic groups. It is also home to a sizeable expatriate community, which constitutes one-fifth of the total population. English, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil are the four official languages spoken in Singapore, with English being the most commonly used language by business corporations, government institutions and locals. As an international tourist destination, Singapore has a fully-developed tourism industry, and this includes professional guides and translators fluent in a variety of foreign languages such as French, German, Japanese and Korean.
				</p>
                <p align="justify">
				Singapore has the world’s best infrastructure, supporting the daily living and commute of many Singaporeans, local residents and tourists. The city is well-served by our extensive air connectivity, thriving seaport and efficient communications network, allowing Singapore to be well connected to the key global economies and bringing together industry experts and business professionals.
				</p>

				<h2>International Air Access</h2>
                <p align="justify">
				Located at the crossroads of the East and West, Singapore is well-positioned to access close to 4 billion people within a 7-hour flight radius. As one of Asia’s best-connected airports, Changi Airport serves more than 120 international and budget airlines connecting to over 400 cities in more than 100 countries, with over 7,400 scheduled weekly flights. Delegates from over 150 cities have the option of taking a direct flight to Singapore.
				</p>
			
                <p align="justify">
				Singapore’s appeal as a destination – with diverse shopping options, dining, entertainment and heritage offerings – attracted approximately 19.1 million international visitors in 2019, with more than 70% of international visitors from Asia. Our top 5 international visitor markets are China, Indonesia, India, Malaysia and Australia. Singapore is well connected to major parts of the world through high frequency and availability of flights. The following figure shows Singapore’s connectivity to some member countries of ISCAS.
