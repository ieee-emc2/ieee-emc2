                <h1>CASS and Climate change : How our community could contribute</h1>
				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p align="justify">
				The world is going into a disaster if no actions are taken soon to stop the global warming and the corresponding climate change. This workshop is aiming to be a working and meeting place to discuss current and future issues produced by the climate change and to define a roadmap of specific actions that need to be taken by CASS members, IEEE, and the research community at large to reduce the impact of the global warming.
				<p align="justify">
				Technology should play an important and essential role in this initiative as it provides ways to measure and analyze data that will show where we are regarding GHG emissions for example and can also help defining actions to be taken and, in some cases, automating the actions.
				<p align="justify">
				In the mid-2000s, Johan Rockström, founding Director of Sweden’s Resilience Center, was looking to define the boundaries for a “safe operating space for humanity” on the planet. He gathered a team of scientist who worked together and define 9 planetary boundaries, influenced by humanity, that threaten the stability of the entire Earth System. These boundaries were published in 2009 and are: climate change, biodiversity integrity, ocean acidification, depletion of the ozone layer, atmospheric aerosol pollution, biogeochemical flows of nitrogen and phosphorus, freshwater use, land-system change, and release of novel chemicals. The researchers estimated a limit of how much human activities can alter each of these processes before the the global system would pass a tipping point — a threshold beyond which we risk sending the Earth spiraling into a state that hasn’t been experienced for the entirety of human existence, bringing extreme change that could crash civilization and endanger humanity<sup>1</sup>. 
				<p align="justify">
				In 2015, the Stockholm Resilience Center estimates how seven planetary boundaries have changed from 1950 to present<sup>2</sup>.
				<p align="justify">
				A new economic theory, The Doughnut Economics<sup>3</sup>, is based on these planet boundaries and the UN Sustainable Development Goals<sup>4</sup>.
				<p align="justify">
				Different human activities have affected not only the planetary boundaries, but also the life on the planet. We are seeing drastic consequences on human health, on migration, of food security, on poverty to just mention some of them.
				<p align="justify">
				In 2021, Bill Gates published a book<sup>5</sup> regarding climate change and proposing some ideas to avoid this disaster. The book presents several topics that are influencing the change of climate: Energy, Manufacturing, Food Production, Transportation, Heating and Air Conditioning.
				<p align="justify">
				Lancet published a report in 2021 which says, “neither COVID-19 nor climate change respect national borders. Without widespread, accessible vaccination across all countries and societies, SARS-CoV-2 and its new variants will continue to put the health of everybody at risk<sup>6</sup>. Likewise, tackling climate change requires all countries to deliver an urgent and coordinated response, with COVID-19 recovery funds allocated to support and ensure a just transition to a low-carbon future and climate change adaptation across the globe.” Moreover, as with COVID-19, the health impacts of climate change are inequitable, with disproportionate effects on the most susceptible populations in every society. While the world’s attention has been diverted towards the ongoing acute health crisis, the health effects of human-induced climate change continue to increase. On the current trajectory, climate change will become the defining narrative of human health. Moreover, the people least responsible for climate change are most exposed to its impacts.
